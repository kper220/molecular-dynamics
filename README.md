| Week | Summary |
| -- | -- |
| 6/10 - 6/16 | |
| 6/7 - 6/9 | Matthews pg. 1 - 7 (introduction), 18 - 28 (N-body problem, Hamiltonian, and flow maps), 44 - 46 (variational equations), 60 - 70 (Verlet method), 211 - 214 (canonical ensemble).<br>Learned about stochastic processes and stochastic differential equations, matrix calculus. Simulated a random walk algorithm.<br>Recommended: solve (without reference) the equations of motion for the simple N-body system (example 1.5). |
